You should probably do this in a Python 3 virtual environment.

`conda create -n MspRE python==3.7`

`conda activate MspRE`

`conda install pip`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**data**

We used BB, ChemPort, SciERC, and CMeIE datasets. These public datasets can be found on the corresponding websites.
